server sided gun sounds



simple drag and drop but there is something you will have to do 

create a SFX folder named "sfx" Drag the "weapons_player" folder and the "resident" Folder and drag it into the sfx folder you created ! 

remove the [] from the "WEAPONS_PLAYER" and the "RESIDENT" AFTER PUTTING INTO THE "SFX" Folder 


Make sure to install right or you'll make it not work ! Should look like the following  below
